Introduce new spell priority feature ``wait=N''.

Setting wait=N in a Spell() or Item() action will cause that action to
have priority over later actions if the later actions start within N
seconds of that action's start time.

In the following example, Crusader Strike will be suggested over later
actions as long as it is within 0.2 seconds of the Crusader Strike
cooldown, otherwise Judgment will be suggested within 0.2 seconds of the
Judgment cooldown, followed by Templars Verdict or Holy Prism using normal
start time comparisons.

    Spell(crusader_strike wait=0.2)
    Spell(judgment wait=0.2)
    Spell(templars_verdict)
    Spell(holy_prism)

Warlock: Fixes to destruction script for Immolate and Rain of Fire.

- Use the correct spell ID for the instant-cast Rain of Fire gained by
  destruction warlocks after level 54 (Aftermath).

- Also check for the Immolate debuff applied to targets near an Immolate
  target when determining whether a fresh Immolate must be cast on the
  current target.

Fixes from @ShmooDude in ticket 284.

Treat snapshotTime as a field that needs to be copied for snapshots.

This fixes auras not gaining any snapshots when "aura" debugging is
enabled.

Add a "snapshot" debug toggle to only know when a new snapshot is taken.

Quiet down the debugging for PaperDoll a bit by removing some lines that
were needed solely for debugging the MH/OH damage computation.
