1.0.4.2

1.0.4.1
==========

* Fixes a bug in the command line, where unused slots would not be set to none as they should

** There is a new priority option Rising Sun Kick Debuff, which should be put in before Tiger Power to ensure the 10% damage increase from the start

* Promoting to release.

1.0 rc2b
==========
* Fixed a bug where sub 90 monks would not get jab suggested.

* Default priority for Energizing brew has been moved to 2nd place.
* Fixed a bug where the change spec button would not show on initial load
* Localization added, now it just need to get [[http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/clcinfo_monk/localization|translated]]

1.0 rc1
==========
* Added support for levelling Monks. Only known abilities will be suggested. The priority list can be left as if max level.
* Removed Ability Abbreviations tab, seems unnecessary now that macro export is available.
* Relaxed Fist of Fury usage rule. Fists of Fury should be suggested more often now.
* Tweaked the Brewmaster, since it had broken a little bit after the rather massive changes for the Windwalker last version.
* The Brewmaster options now include a setting for adjusting Keg Smash usage.

1.0 beta5
==========
* There is no longer an 'Energy Wait Threshold'
* There is now a 'Latency Adjust' to use if experiencing that abilities are suggested during GCD that are in fact not usable. This is due to the fact that the API will return an incorrect status on resources (chi, energy) a fraction of time after the ability was used.
* Added a number of templates for Cds, Xuen for instance. Just add a new icon and choose from the list.
* Tested and fixed numerous issues with the Windwalker priorities
** Fist of Fury will no longer be suggested if it would mean capping energy
** There is no longer a 'Fists of Fury Wait Threshold' option as that didn't really make any sense.
** Added the missing Tiger Eye brew to the rotation options
** Added Tiger Eye brew 3rd icon to default template, to leave it out of the actual rotation
** Logic for Energizing Brew use changed. It now suggests use if the time needed to reach enough energy to use an energy ability is greater than a configurable threshold.
* Finished macro export
* Created a few messages here and there to inform of changes
* Fixed some commandline logic

1.0 beta4
==========
 * Added checks for glyphs that alter behavior, for instance Guard
 * Updated options to be more intuitive with regards to active template, changing prio on a spec that isn't the active template doesn't make sense
 * Added option to create new templates for a given class module
 * Default templates are created for new users (as in never used clcInfo before). Users without Monk templates will be asked on initial loggin if they want to create them.
 * Added the ability to change specs on the inactive spec's class module option screen
 * Added export to macro option on the class module option screen (still needs some work)

 * Welcome screen to facilitate template setup for new users
