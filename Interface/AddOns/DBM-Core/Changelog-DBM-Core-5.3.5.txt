Tagging as 5.3.5


--------------------

subversion:
	- increment version number to 5.3.5
root:
	- tandanu via svn r10055: remove pvp mods
	- ebmor via svn r10052: DBM-InfoFrame: the only purpose of IsInGroup seems to be that the InfoFrame does not work as expected if you are not in a group - removed! (solo "for uId in DBM:GetGroupMembers()": "player")
	- ebmor via svn r10051: fix defect InfoFrame, not working since r9485 / 10 May 2013 (maybe certain areas/localizations only)
	do not use GetRealZoneText(), e.g. ThronofThunder deDE:
	RaidRosterInfo: "Der Thron des Donners"
	RealZoneText: "Thron des Donners"
	- Omega via svn r10050: Improve proving ground mods support (all proving grounds instances are name format "Proving Grounds: Location" so lets just strip the redundant first part ;)
	- Omega via svn r10049: Fix nasty bug in all SoO mods
	- ebmor via svn r10048: deDE update
	- tandanu via svn r10047: typo
	- Omega via svn r10046: comment some stuff out
	- tandanu via svn r10045: show a warning if someone is running deprecated mods that might cause problems
	- tandanu via svn r10044: fix bad logic
	- Omega via svn r10043: change other 2 options too
	- Omega via svn r10042: make infoframe on ra-den only on by default for 10 man (should work for most, unless they load mod by hand outside of raid first time) Make info frame on ra-den only show up after first debuff as gone out This should be in very good shape for 10 man use now. 25 man use works too but it's not as fast at calling names out as calebs mod so most don't use it on 25 man still.
	- Omega via svn r10041: revert SpecWarn_FlashColor change, adding number to them messes up layout (text goes to new line) and i don't feel like messing with all that
	- Omega via svn r10040: try this for loading
	- ultrashining via svn r10039: zhTW update

	- Omega via svn r10022: test delayed, i had time to localize that infoframe now

	- Omega via svn r10003: Thok prep
	- tandanu via svn r10002: * change special warning fade in/out animation to a quadratic curve which gives a much smoother result * update default values for the display duration * change font size slider to not offer way too big font sizes as these won't work anyways...
	- Omega via svn r10001: small norushen update for tomorrow
